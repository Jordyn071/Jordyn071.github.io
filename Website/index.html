                        <p class="color-gray">
                          Cyberbullying is bullying that takes place over digital devices like cell phones, computers, and tablets. 
						  Cyberbullying can occur through SMS, Text, and apps, or online in social media, forums, or 
						  gaming where people can view, participate in, or share content. Cyberbullying includes sending, posting, 
						  or sharing negative, harmful, false, or mean content about someone else. It can include sharing personal
						  or private information about someone else causing embarrassment or humiliation. Some cyberbullying crosses 
						  the line into unlawful or criminal behavior.<br> 

							<h5 class="color-gray font-weight-bold">The most common places where cyberbullying occurs are:</h5>
							<ul>
								<li>Social Media, such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Tik Tok</li>
								<li>Text messaging and messaging apps on mobile or tablet devices</li>
								<li>Instant messaging, direct messaging, and online chatting over the internet</li>
								<li>Online forums, chat rooms, and message boards, such as Reddit</li>
								<li>Email</li>
								<li>Online gaming communities</li>

                        <p class="mb-0 color-gray">
							With the prevalence of social media and digital forums, comments, photos, posts, and content shared by individuals 
							can often be viewed by strangers as well as acquaintances. The content an individual shares online – both their personal
							content as well as any negative, mean, or hurtful content – creates a kind of permanent public record of their views, 
							activities, and behavior. This public record can be thought of as an online reputation, which may be accessible to schools, 
							employers, colleges, clubs, and others who may be researching an individual now or in the future. Cyberbullying can harm the 
							online reputations of everyone involved – not just the person being bullied, but those doing the bullying or participating in it. 
							Cyberbullying has unique concerns in that it can be:	<br>
								<strong>Persistent</strong> - Digital devices offer an ability to immediately and continuously communicate 24 hours a day, so it can be difficult for children experiencing cyberbullying to find relief.							
								<strong>Permanent</strong> - Most information communicated electronically is permanent and public, if not reported and removed. A negative online reputation, including for those who bully, can impact college admissions, employment, and other areas of life.
								<strong>Hard to Notice</strong> - Because teachers and parents may not overhear or see cyberbullying taking place, it is harder to recognize.

							<p class="mb-5">
								<h5 class="color-gray ">If you want, you can start by trying to deal with the problem yourself. Here are some options:</h5>
								 <br> <strong> Asking them to stop</strong> - You can tell the person that if they don’t stop or otherwise fix the problem, you’ll complain to the people who host the material. For example, if the person is posting abusive comments about you on Facebook, warn them you’ll complain to the site’s administrators and that they might end up getting banned from using Facebook.
								 <br> <strong> Blocking them</strong> - For example, by blocking their incoming phone calls, or unfriending them on Facebook, or blocking them on Twitter or TradeMe.
								 <br> <strong> Complaining to the online host</strong> - You may be able to get the relevant social media site, app host, phone company or other online host to remove the material or take some other action to fix the problem. Since July 2015, the Harmful Digital Communications Act has provided incentives for all these “online content hosts” to set up complaints processes that are effective and easy to access (this is explained in the next section).
								</p>

							<p>
							 <div class="mb-5">
								<h1 class="page-title color-primary mb-5">Complaining to the website, phone company or other “online host”</h1><hr>
									<p class="mb-5">
										<h5 class="color-gray">How to complain </h5><hr>
										You can make a written complaint with the online host yourself, or you can ask NetSafe, as the cyberbullying complaints agency, to make the complaint for you, on your behalf.
										<br>NetSafe can also give you advice and help about your complaint.</p>
										
										<p>
										<h5 class="color-gray">What to include in your complaint </h5><hr>
										Your complaint should be in writing and should:<br>
										<ul>
											<li>give your contact details, including a physical address</li>
											<li>identify the particular material so the host can locate it easily</li>
											<li>say why you think the material you’re complaining about either breaches the communications principles or is “unlawful” (it could be unlawful because, for example, it includes false statements that are defamatory)</li>
											<li>say whether you agree to the host identifying you when they pass on your complaint to the person responsible for the material.</li>
										</ul></p>
											<h5 class="color-gray">The complaints process </h5><hr>
										<p>Since July 2015, the Harmful Digital Communications Act has encouraged all people or organisations that 
										host online content to provide their users with a complaints process that’s effective and easy to access.</p>
										<p>The “online content hosts” covered by the Act include phone companies, media companies and Internet Service Providers (ISPs), 
										and also all people who run websites, social media pages, online forums and blogs on which other people can post comments, pictures or videos.</p>
										<p>The incentive the Act provides is that these online hosts can protect themselves from legal responsibility for material posted by other people
										if the host follows the complaints process set out in the Act. These protections are sometimes called “safe harbour” provisions. They will, for example, 
										protect a website operator from being sued for defamation if a user posts false statements about someone.</p>
										<p>To benefit from the safe harbour protections, an online content host must:
											<ul>
												<li>provide an easily accessible way for people to complain about content – such as a simple button or other clear link on the host’s website, and</li>
												<li>once a complaint is made, follow the steps explained below, including the relevant time limits.</li>
											</ul>

							<h5 class="color-gray">What Are the Effects of Cyberbullying?</h5><hr>
							Kids have almost constant access to their devices, so cyberbullying is hard to escape. 
							Kids and teens can feel like they never get a break and feel the effects very strongly.
							</p>
							<p>Kids who are cyberbullied can struggle to concentrate in school, which can affect how well they do there. Cyberbullying that is severe, long-lasting, or happens a lot can cause anxiety, depression, and other stress-related disorders in victims and bullies. In rare cases, some kids have attempted or died from suicide.</p>
							<p>Cyberbullies also can be suspended or expelled from school or kicked off of sports teams. Depending on the severity of the cyberbullying, kids also might be in legal trouble.</p>
							
							<p>
							  <h5 class="color-gray">What Are the Effects of Cyberbullying?</h5><hr>
							  Many kids and teens who are cyberbullied don't want to tell a teacher, parent, or trusted adults, often because they feel ashamed or fear that their devices will be taken away at home.
							</p> 
							<p>
							Signs of cyberbullying vary, but may include:<br>
								<ul>
									<li>being emotionally upset during or after using the Internet or the phone</li>
									<li>being very secretive or protective of one's digital life</li>
									<li>spending more time than usual in their room</li>
									<li>withdrawal from or lack of interest in family members, friends, and activities</li>
									<li>avoiding school or group gatherings</li>
									<li>slipping grades and "acting out" in anger at home</li>
									<li>changes in mood, behavior, sleep, or appetite</li>
									<li>suddenly wanting to stop using the computer or device</li>
									<li>being nervous or jumpy when getting a message, text, or email</li>
									<li>avoiding discussions about computer or phone activities</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>
							  <h5 class="color-gray">How Can Parents Help?</h5><hr>
							  If your child is being cyberbullied:
			
							  <ul>
								<li><b>Offer comfort and support.</b> Talking about any bullying experiences you had in your childhood might help your child feel less alone.</li><br>
								<li><b>Let your child know that it's not their fault.</b> Bullying says more about the bully than the victim. Praise your child for doing the right thing by talking to you about it. Remind your child you're in this together. Reassure your child that you'll figure out what to do</li><br>
								<li><b>Notify the school.</b> Tell the principal, school nurse, or a counselor or teacher about the situation. Many schools, school districts, and after-school clubs have rules for responding to cyberbullying. These vary by district and state. But before reporting the problem, let your child know that you plan to do so, so that you can work out a plan that makes you both feel comfortable.</li><br>
								<li><b>Encourage your child not to respond to cyberbullying.</b> Doing so just makes the situation worse.</li><br>
								<li><b>Keep records.</b> Keep screen shots of the threatening messages, pictures, and texts. These can be used as evidence with the bully's parents, school, employer, or even the police.</li><br>
								<li><b>Get help.</b> If your child agrees, meeting with a therapist may help work through feelings. A counselor or mediator at school may work with your child alone or together with the bully.</li><br>
							  </ul>
							  Other things that may prevent future cyberbullying:
							  
							  <ul>
								<li><b>Block the bully.</b> Most devices have settings that let you electronically block emails, messages, or texts from specific people.</li><br>
								<li><b>Limit access to technology.</b> Although it is hurtful, many kids who are bullied can't resist the temptation to check websites or phones to see if there are new messages. Keep the computer in a public place in the house and put limits on the use of cellphones and games. You might be able to turn off text messaging services during certain hours, and most websites, apps, and smartphones include parental control options that give parents access to their kids' messages and online life.</li><br>
								<li><b>Consider monitoring your child’s social media use.</b> Programs and apps are available that can monitor kids' social media accounts and alert parents to any inappropriate language or photos. Some can give detailed reports of a child's browsing history and tell a parent how much time they spent online and on each site. Consider your child’s age and digital behavior when deciding whether to monitor devices. Then, if you choose to monitor, talk to them about it and explain why it's important.</li><br>
								<li><b>Know what sites your child uses.</b> This is your chance to encourage kids and teens to teach you about something they know well — technology! This shows your child that you are interested in how they spend their time online, while helping you understand how to best monitor their online safety.</li><br>
								<li><b>Be part of your kids' online world.</b> Ask to "friend" or "follow" your child on social media sites, but do not abuse this privilege by commenting or posting anything to your child's profile. Check their postings and the sites kids visit, and be aware of how they spend their time online.</li><br>
								<li><b>Put it in writing.</b> Write smartphone and social media contracts for your kids that you're willing to enforce.</li><br>

							  <h5 class="color-gray">What Else Should I Know?<h5><hr>
							  What if it's your kid who's behaving badly? While that can be upsetting, it's important to deal with the problem and not expect it to go away. No matter what's causing the bullying, tell your child that it's unacceptable. Set and enforce consequences if it continues. If needed, talk with teachers, guidance counselors, and others who might be able to help.</p>
							  <p>As always, be a role model for your kids. Help them understand the benefits and dangers of the digital world. If you don't get upset and use angry words in your own posts and replies, they're less likely to. Talk about healthy ways to respond — or not — when you disagree with others.</p>

                          <hr><p class="mb-5">
							The Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 set up special processes you can use if you’re being harassed or bullied through texts, emails, websites, apps or social media posts. The aim is to provide a relatively quick and easy way for harm to be reduced, including by getting harmful posts or messages taken down or disabled, while at the same time giving people appropriate room for freedom of expression.
                          </p>
						  <p>
							One of the features introduced by this Act is a special complaints and mediation agency. NetSafe, the internet safety organisation, has been appointed to play this role.
						  </p>
						  <p>
						  If going to NetSafe doesn’t fix the problem, you can apply to the District Court. The judge can do things like order the harmful post to be taken down, or order the person responsible to publish a correction or an apology.
						  </p>
						  <p>
						   The Act also establishes a number of specific principles to guide online/digital behaviour (see below). NetSafe and judges have to take these principles into account when they’re dealing with claims that someone has been cyberbullied.
						  </p><br>
							  <h5 class="color-gray">The 10 principles for online/digital behaviour<h5><hr>
							  <p>
							  The Harmful Digital Communications Act sets out 10 principles that apply to texts, emails and online posts – what the Act calls “digital communications”.
							  </p>
							  <p>
							  NetSafe, as the cyberbullying complaints agency, is supposed to take these principles into account when it’s considering a complaint. If complaining to NetSafe doesn’t solve the problem and you decide to take your complaint to the District Court, the judge will also have to take these principles into account.
							  </p>
							  <p>
							  The principles say that “digital communications” that are sent to you or are about you shouldn’t do any of the following things:
							  <ul>
								<li>give out sensitive personal information about you</li>
								<li>be threatening, intimidating or menacing</li>
								<li>be grossly offensive, as judged by any reasonable person in your position</li>
								<li>be indecent or obscene</li>
								<li>be used to harass you</li>
								<li>make false claims about you</li>
								<li>contain information or material that you had given to someone in confidence</li>
								<li>encourage other people to send you a message for the purpose of causing you harm</li>
								<li>encourage you to kill yourself</li>
								<li>put you down (“denigrate” you) on the basis of your colour, race, ethnic or national origins, religion, gender, sexual orientation or disability.</li>
							  </ul>
							  </p><br>
							  
								<h5 class="color-gray">Other laws that can be used against cyberbullying</h5><hr>
								<h5><a href="https://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1997/0092/latest/DLM417078.html?search=ts_act%40bill%40regulation%40deemedreg_Harassment+Act+1997_resel_25_a&p=1%2f">The Harassment Act</a></h5>
								<hr><p>The Harassment Act covers harassment and intimidation across a wide range of different forms, whether it’s through texts, emails or online posts, or through face-to-face harassment, stalking or letters. The Act says it applies where someone leaves offensive pictures or text where you’ll see it, and this specifically includes online material.</p>
								<p>The protections in the Harassment Act have sometimes been used in cases of online harassment. The Act allows you to apply to the District Court for a restraining order to stop the harassing behaviour.</p>
